Need to finish news: use 3 apis (py files empty)
Input and output format of the LLM_HF_summariser is fine, also rendering in news letter is fine! 

Note that use_llm in news_data is set to true and python preview_newsletter.py can be used to do a newsletter simmulation

Next steps: 

Error handling (a.o. need to add some errros/tickers length checks)
Double checks of information/multiple API 
Agno framework experimentations?
Opmaak newsletter?
Unit tes?
Replace print by log
Update the ReadME
