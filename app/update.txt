Goal: have quality content !!

Update:

Need Google documentation cleanup !! (research tab, api table) 

APIS
5x (2 search and 3 apis) - test them first for validation, documnetation and parsing in the test folder

AGENT TYPES
3x search, crosscheck and summariser



Questions:

Which articles are kept? Also what about parsing interpreattion
Quid if no news? 
Probably too strict with APIs, should not check on source once the RetrieverSearch agents have identifiedthe news... (addtional ticker relevant checks why not)

ToDos:

Implement APIs (see doc folder) with different args (see base class for generic approach)
Implement ChatGPT websearc has well
Agno framework is not implemented (could be for sraper and summariser..)
Make an architecture diagram of my repo

Notes:

EXA/Google news source filters (bcs only crosschecks these articles)
One agent is made per type (so for one Ticker the scraper agent invokes two APIS EXA and Google News)

Next steps :

Front end (ticker list and emails) and newsletter format 
Databse for multiple users
